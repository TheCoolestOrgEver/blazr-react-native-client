#blazr

(Ignore our giant over inflated commit sizes we probably pushed some packages by accident lol but pods are a pain to install so I'll let it slide)

Ever travel to a new place and just wish a local could show you around? Or maybe you only interact with a limited amount of people now that you're out of college. Dating apps make things weird when you're just trying to meet people. That's why we made blazr, a stripped down version of Tinder, focused solely on making friendships.
